# OsrsSimulations
Dps (damage-per-second) and fight duration calculations for OSRS.
Right now gear bonuses, combat levels and npc's stats are hardcoded.

Todo/improve ideas:
- Make code more reusable (= less hardcoding)
- take bonuses and stats as input?
- make fight simulations, don't rely on averages
